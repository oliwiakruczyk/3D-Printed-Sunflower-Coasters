# 3D-Printed-Sunflower-Coasters

This project involves the creation of sunflower coasters that can be detached from their branches. The sunflowers are attached using magnets and are designed to serve as coasters for cups. These coasters are produced using 3D printing technology.

The sunflower coasters are designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. They are attached to branches using magnets, allowing for easy removal and use as individual coasters. The entire setup is created using 3D printing technology, ensuring precision and durability.

## Design and Functionality

### Sunflower Coasters
- **Design:** Each sunflower coaster is designed to resemble a real sunflower, with intricate details that mimic the petals and center.
- **Functionality:** The coasters are sturdy enough to hold cups and protect surfaces from heat and moisture.

## Manufacturing Process

### 3D Printing
- **Material:** The coasters and branches are printed using high-quality 3D printing filament, ensuring durability and a high level of detail.
- **Printing Process:** The design is printed layer by layer, creating precise and detailed sunflower coasters.

### Assembly
- **Magnet Embedding:** Magnets are embedded into the coasters and branches during the printing process, ensuring a secure fit.
- **Final Touches:** Any necessary finishing touches are applied to ensure the coasters are ready for use.
